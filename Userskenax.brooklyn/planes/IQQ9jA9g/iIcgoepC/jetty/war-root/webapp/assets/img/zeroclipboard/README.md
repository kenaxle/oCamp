For the clipboard to work, the ZeroClipboard.swf artifact (v1.3.5) needs to be 
downloaded and installed in this directory. Maven will do this automatically for
you on first run and thereafter use the downloaded version.

If you do not wish to have it, simply create an empty file with that name in this dir.

You can download it manually from:

    http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/zeroclipboard/1.3.5/ZeroClipboard.swf

It can be built from source using a free toolchain as described at 

    https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md .

It is not checked in because binary artifacts should not be included in source releases
due to Apache policies. This project is not currently set up to use bower/npm which would
do the same thing, so instead we follow this process. See also ZeroClipboard.js.
